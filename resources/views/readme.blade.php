        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4 mt-6">Project Details</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
            This project was built using Laravel version X.X, with a MySQL database. The site employs a clean architecture by splitting logic across multiple controllers and models. Migrations and seeders ensure that the database is correctly initialized and populated with dummy data for testing purposes. Security features, including middleware for role management and CSRF tokens, are implemented throughout the site.
